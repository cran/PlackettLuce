# PlackettLuce TODO

## general

* PlackettLuce line 351 - is it necessary to go through set sizes of 1? Maybe 2:nc okay here
* is it necessary to compute X when you have starting values already?
* `A[item] <- unname` where are the names comming from
 - can I do reorder = FALSE (and not sort item's earlier?)
* use better settings for plot of pltree in vignette?
* split up vignette now arxiv article published
 - basic introduction
 - comparison with other packages
 - trees
 - adherence/MAP estimation

## for datacamp

* change grouped_rankings to group_rankings (verb) - deprecate grouped_rankings.
