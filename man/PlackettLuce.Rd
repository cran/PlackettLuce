\arguments{
\item{rankings}{a \code{"\link{rankings}"} object, or an object that can be

should be used when estimating adherence for rankers
with multiple rankings per ranker.}

\item{npseudo}{when using pseudodata: the number of wins and losses to add
between each object and a hypothetical reference object.}

\item{normal}{a optional list with elements named \code{mu} and \code{Sigma}
specifying the mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate normal prior on
the \emph{log} worths.}

\item{gamma}{a optional list with elements named \code{shape} and \code{rate}
specifying parameters of a gamma prior on adherence parameters for each
ranker (use \code{grouped_rankings} to group multiple rankings by ranker).
The short-cut \code{TRUE} may be used to specify a Gamma(10, 10) prior. If
\code{NULL} (or \code{FALSE}), adherence is fixed to \code{adherence} for
all rankers.}

\code{NULL}, this specifies the starting values for the adherence.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights for each ranking.}

\item{start}{starting values for the worth parameters and the tie parameters
on the raw scale (worth parameters need not be scaled to sum to 1). If
\code{normal} is specified, \code{exp(normal$mu)} is used as starting values

\code{\link{optim}} interface), \code{"L-BFGS"} (the limited-memory BFGS
optimisation algorithm as implemented in the \code{\link[lbfgs]{lbfgs}}

Fit a Plackett-Luce model to a set of rankings. The rankings may be partial
(not all objects ranked) and include ties of any order.

\section{Model definition}{


A single ranking is given by
\deqn{R = \{C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_J\}}{R = {C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_J}}
where the items in set \eqn{C_1} are ranked higher than (better than) the
items in \eqn{C_2}, and so on. If there are multiple objects in set \eqn{C_j}
these items are tied in the ranking.

For a set if items \eqn{S}, let
\deqn{f(S) = \delta_{|S|}
      \left(\prod_{i \in S} \alpha_i \right)^\frac{1}{|S|}}{
      f(S) = delta_{|S|} * (prod_{i in S} alpha_i)^(1/|S|)}
where \eqn{|S|} is the cardinality (size) of the set, \eqn{\delta_n}{delta_n} is a
parameter related to the prevalence of ties of order \eqn{n}, and
\eqn{\alpha_i}{alpha_i} is a parameter representing the worth of item \eqn{i}.
Then under an extension of the Plackett-Luce model allowing ties up to order
\eqn{D}, the probability of the ranking \eqn{R} is given by
\deqn{\prod_{j = 1}^J \frac{f(C_j)}{
      \sum_{k = 1}^{\min(D_j, D)} \sum_{S \in {A_j \choose k}} f(S)}}{
      prod_{j = 1}^J f(C_j)/
      (sum_{k = 1}^{min(D_j, D)} sum_{S in choose(A_j, k)} f(S))}
where \eqn{D_j} is the cardinality of \eqn{C_j}, \eqn{A_j} is the set of
alternatives from which \eqn{C_j} is chosen, and
\eqn{A_j \choose k}{choose(A_j, k)} is all the possible choices of \eqn{k}
items from \eqn{A_j}. The value of \eqn{D} can be set to the maximum number
of tied items observed in the data, so that \eqn{\delta_n = 0}{delta_n = 0} for
\eqn{n > D}.

When the worth parameters are constrained to sum to one, they represent the
probability that the corresponding item comes first in a ranking of all
items, given that first place is not tied.

The 2-way tie prevalence parameter \eqn{\delta_2}{delta_2} is related to
the probability that two items \emph{of equal worth} tie for
first place, given that the first place is not a 3-way or higher tie.
Specifically, that probability is
\eqn{\delta_2/(2 + \delta_2)}{delta_2/(2 + delta_2}.

The 3-way and higher tie-prevalence parameters are similarly interpretable,
in terms of tie probabilities among equal-worth items.
}

\section{Pseudo-rankings}{


In order for the maximum likelihood estimate of an object's worth to be
defined, the network of rankings must be strongly connected. This means that
in every possible partition of the objects into two nonempty subsets, some
object in the second set is ranked higher than some object in the first set
at least once.

If the network of rankings is not strongly connected then pseudo-rankings
may be used to connect the network. This approach posits a hypothetical
object with log-worth 0 and adds \code{npseudo} wins and \code{npseudo}
losses to the set of rankings.

The parameter \code{npseudo} is the prior strength.  With \code{npseudo = 0}
the MLE is the posterior mode.  As \code{npseudo} approaches
infinity the log-worth estimates all shrink towards 0. The default,
\code{npseudo = 0.5}, is sufficient to connect the network and has a weak
shrinkage effect. Even for networks that are already connected, adding
pseudo-rankings reduces both the bias and variance of the estimates.
}

\section{Incorporating prior information on log-worths}{


Prior information can be incorporated by using \code{normal} to specify a
multivariate normal prior on the \emph{log}-worths. The log-worths are then
estimated by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Model summaries (deviance, AIC,
standard errors) are based on the log-likelihood evaluated at the MAP
estimates, resulting in a finite sample bias that should disappear as
the number of rankings increases. Inference based on these model summaries
is valid as long as the prior is considered fixed and not tuned as part of
the model.

Incorporating a prior is an alternative method of penalization, therefore
\code{npseudo} is set to zero when a prior is specified.
}

\section{Incorporating ranker adherence parameters}{


When rankings come from different rankers, the model can be extended to
allow for varying reliability of the rankers, as proposed by Raman and
Joachims (2014). In particular, replacing \eqn{f(S)} by
\deqn{h(S) = \delta_{|S|}
      \left(\prod_{i \in S} \alpha_i \right)^\frac{\eta_g}{|S|}}{
      h(S) = delta_{|S|} * (prod_{i in S} alpha_i)^(eta_g/|S|)}
where \eqn{\eta_g > 0}{eta_g > 0} is the adherence parameter for ranker \eqn{g}. In
the standard model, all rankers are assumed to have equal reliability, so
\eqn{\eta_g = 1}{eta_g = 1} for all rankers. Higher \eqn{\eta_g = 1}{eta_g = 1}
increases the distance between item worths, giving greater weight
to the ranker's choice. Conversely, lower \eqn{\eta_g = 1}{eta_g = 1} shrinks
the item worths towards equality so the ranker's choice is less relevant.

The adherence parameters are not estimable by maximum likelihood, since
for given item worths the maximum likelihood estimate of adherence would be
infinity for rankers that give rankings consistent with the items ordered by
worth and zero for all other rankers. Therefore it is essential to include a
prior on the adherence parameters when these are estimated rather than fixed.
Setting \code{gamma = TRUE} specifies the default
\eqn{\Gamma(10,10)}{Gamma(10,10)} prior, which has a mean of
1 and a probability of 0.99 that the adherence is between 0.37 and 2.
Alternative parameters can be specified by a list with elements \code{shape}
and \code{rate}. Setting scale and rate to a common value \eqn{\theta}{theta}
specifies a mean of 1; \eqn{\theta \ge}{theta >=} 2 will give low prior probability
to near-zero adherence; as \eqn{\theta}{theta} increases the density becomes
more concentrated (and more symmetrical) about 1.

Since the number of adherence parameters will typically be large and it is
assumed the worth and tie parameters are of primary interest, the adherence
parameters are not included in model summaries, by are included in the
returned object.
}

\section{Controlling the fit}{


For models without priors, using \code{nspseudo = 0} will use standard
maximum likelihood, if the network is connected (and throw an error
otherwise).

The fitting algorithm is set by the \code{method} argument. The default
method \code{"iterative scaling"} is a slow but reliable approach. In
addition, this has the most control on the accuracy of the final fit, since
convergence is determined by direct comparison of the observed and expected
values of the sufficient statistics for the worth parameters, rather than a
tolerance on change in the log-likelihood.

The \code{"iterative scaling"} algorithm is slow because it is a first order
method (does not use derivatives of the likelihood). From a set of starting
values that are 'close enough' to the final solution, the algorithm can be
accelerated using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffensen\%27s_method}{Steffensen's method}.
\code{PlackettLuce} attempts to apply Steffensen's acceleration when all
differences between the observed and expected values of the sufficient
statistics are less than \code{steffensen}. This is an ad-hoc rule defining
'close enough' and in some cases the acceleration may produce negative
worth parameters or decrease the log-likelihood. \code{PlackettLuce} will
only apply the update when it makes an improvement.

The \code{"BFGS"} and \code{"L-BFGS"} algorithms are second order methods,
therefore can be quicker than the default method. Control parameters can be
passed on to \code{\link[stats]{optim}} or \code{\link[lbfgs]{lbfgs}}.

For models with priors, the iterative scaling method cannot be used, so BFGS
is used by default.
