\title{Check Connectivity of Rankings}
\usage{
connectivity(x, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an adjacency matrix as returned by \code{\link{adjacency}}, a
\code{"\link{rankings}"} object, or an object that can be coerced
by \code{as.rankings}.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, a message is given if the network
is not strongly connected.}
}
\value{
a list with elements
\item{membership}{a labelled vector of indices specifying membership of
clusters in the network of items}
\item{csize}{the sizes of clusters in the network of items}
\item{no}{the number of clusters in the network of items}
}
\description{
Check the connectivity of the network underlying a set of rankings.
}
\details{
Ranked items are connected in a directed graph according to the implied
wins and loses between pairs of items. The wins and losses can be
summarised as an adjacency matrix using \code{\link{adjacency}}. From this
adjacency matrix, the graph is inferred and it is checked for
connectivity. A message is given if the network is not strongly connected,
i.e. with at least one win and one loss between all partitions of the network
into two groups. Features of clusters in the network are returned - if
the network is strongly connected, all items belong to the same cluster.

\examples{
## weakly connected network:
## one win between two clusters
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 0, 0,
              2, 1, 3, 0,
              0, 0, 1, 2,
              0, 0, 2, 1), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
X <- as.rankings(X)
res <- connectivity(X)
res$membership
## keep items in cluster 1
X[,res$membership == 1]

## two weakly connected items:
## item 1 always loses; item 4 only wins against item 1
X <- matrix(c(4, 1, 2, 3,
              0, 2, 1, 3), nr = 2, byrow = TRUE)
X <- as.rankings(X)
res <- connectivity(X)
res$membership

## item 1 always wins; item 4 always loses
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4,
              1, 3, 2, 4), nr = 2, byrow = TRUE)
res <- connectivity(as.rankings(X))
res$membership

## all in separate clusters: always 1 > 2 > 3 > 4
## also miscoded rankings and redundant ranking
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4,
              1, 0, 2, 3,
              1, 1, 2, 0,
              1, 0, 3, 4,
              2, 2, 0, 4,
              0, 0, 3, 0,
              2, 4, 0, 0), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
res <- connectivity(as.rankings(X))
res$membership
