\title{Paired Comparisons of Chocolate Pudding}
\format{A data frame with 15 records and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{i}}{The first brand in the comparison.}
\item{\code{j}}{The second brand in the comparison.}
\item{\code{r_ij}}{The frequency of paired comparisons of brand i and
brand j.}
\item{\code{w_ij}}{The frequency of preferences for i over j.}
\item{\code{w_ji}}{The frequency of preferences for j over i.}
\item{\code{t_ij}}{The frequency of no preference between i and j.}
}}
\usage{
pudding

\description{
This is an example dataset from \cite{Davidson 1970} comprising paired
comparisons of chocolate pudding, with six brands in total. The responses
include tied outcomes, i.e. no preference.

# create orderings for each set of paired comparisons

# wins for brand i and wins for brand j
i_wins <- data.frame(Winner = pudding$i, Loser = pudding$j)

# ties: use an array list (easier with R >= 3.6.0)
if (getRversion() < "3.6.0"){
  n <- nrow(pudding)
  ties <- data.frame(Winner = array(split(pudding[c("i", "j")], 1:n), n),

} else {
  ties <- data.frame(Winner = asplit(pudding[c("i", "j")], 1),
                     Loser = rep(NA, 15))

head(ties, 2)

# convert to rankings
R <- as.rankings(rbind(i_wins, j_wins, ties),
                 input = "orderings")

tail(R, 2)

# define weights as frequencies of each ranking
w <- unlist(pudding[c("w_ij", "w_ji", "t_ij")])

# fit Plackett-Luce model: limit iterations to match paper
mod <- PlackettLuce(R, npseudo = 0, weights = w, maxit = 7)
